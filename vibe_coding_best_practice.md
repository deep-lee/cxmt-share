When I report a bug, don't start by trying to fix it. Instead, start by writing a test that reproduces the bug. Then, have subagents try to fix the bug and prove it with a passing test.

Append "use subagents" to any request where you want Claude to throw more compute at the problem

At the session end: Update your CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again.
